      Please read the following instructions carefully.

      <p>Welcome to Stop/Go!</p>
      <p>This session will consist of 3 matches. At the end of the 3 separate rounds, you will be paid the total amount you have earned during the 3 matches.</p>
      <p>Each match goes as follows: You will be assigned to be either Red or Blue player. You will be paired anonymously with another player of the other color. Red moves first in the match, and has two choices: <strong>STOP</strong> or <strong>GO</strong>.</p>
      <p>If the Red player chooses <strong>STOP</strong>, the match will stop and both players will receive a payoff of $3.00. If the Red player chooses <strong>GO</strong>, it becomes the Blue player's turn to choose either <strong>LEFT</strong> or <strong>RIGHT</strong>. The payoff in this case depends on what move the Blue player has made and the payoff table being used. One of the two payoff tables, shown below, are randomly chosen (there is a 50/50 chance that either table is chosen).</p>
      <p>Only the Red player will see this payoff table. The Blue player will not see the payoff table. The payoff table will be randomly reselected each match.</p>
        <!-- NOTE: currently the stop/game doesn't actually rematch, nor does it keep you as a red or blue player throughout the 3 matches -->
