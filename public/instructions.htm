    <h2>Stop/Go Instructions</h2>
    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
      Please read the following instructions carefully.
    </div>
    <div id="instructions">
      <h3>Welcome to Stop/Go!</h3>
      <p>
        The experiment consists of <strong>3 matches</strong>. At the
        end of the 3 separate matches, you will be paid the total
        amount you have earned [TODO update with USD].
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be assigned to be either
        the
        <strong>Red</strong> or the <strong>Blue</strong> player, and
        you will keep your role for all 3 matches.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Each match, you will be anonymously paired with a different
        player of the other role. You will never play again with the
        same player. Red moves first in the match, and has two
        choices: <strong>STOP</strong> or <strong>GO</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the Red player chooses <strong>STOP</strong>, the match
        stops and both players receive a payoff
        of <span id="payoff-stop"> __ </span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the Red player chooses <strong>GO</strong>, it is the Blue
        player's turn to choose either <strong>LEFT</strong>
        or <strong>RIGHT</strong>. In this case, the payoff depends on
        what move the Blue player has made and on the <strong>state of
        the world</strong>, which is randomly chosen to
        be <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong> (there is a 50/50
        chance for either). Each state of the world has a different
        payoff table, as shown below:
      </p>
      
      <div class="row">
        <div id="payoff-matrix-a" class="panel panel-default half-size">
          <div class="panel-heading">Payoff Table A</div>
          <!-- Payoff Table A added here on init-->
        </div>
        <div id="payoff-matrix-b" class="panel panel-default half-size">
          <div class="panel-heading">Payoff Table B</div>
          <!-- Payoff Table B added here on init -->
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        <em>Important!</em> Only the Red player knows the state of the
        world <em>before</em> making the decision. The Blue player
        will be informed only <em>after</em> making a decision. The
        state of the world is randomly reselected each match.
      </p>
        <!-- NOTE: currently the stop/game doesn't actually rematch, nor does it keep you as a red or blue player throughout the 3 matches -->
    </div>

      the <em>"Done"</em> button to start a short tutorial of the
      game.
